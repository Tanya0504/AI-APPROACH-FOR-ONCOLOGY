Paper title: AI-APPROACH-FOR-ONCOLOGY-USING-MONO-CULTURED-HGB-DATA-FROM-VARIOUS-METHODS.

This repository contains our research paper, "AI Approach for Oncology Using Mono-Cultured HGB Data from Various Methods," which was presented at ICTA24, Uzbekistan. In this study, we leverage AI to classify bacterial species responsible for causing cancer. A mono-culture approach, meaning a single type of species is analyzed, is utilized to ensure precise classification. Our methodology follows a semi-dry lab approach, integrating computational analysis with biological insights. We are the primary authors of this paper, and this research contributes to advancing oncology through AI-driven bacterial classification.
