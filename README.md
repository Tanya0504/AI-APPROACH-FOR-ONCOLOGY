## 📚 About the Research

This repository contains our research paper that explores the application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to classify bacterial species responsible for cancer. The key highlights of our work:

- 🔬 **Mono-culture Approach**: A single type of bacterial species is analyzed for precise classification.
- 🧑‍🔬 **Semi-Dry Lab Methodology**: Integration of computational analysis with biological insights for accurate results.
- 💻 **AI-Driven Classification**: Advanced models are leveraged to assist in cancer research and bacterial identification.

We are the **primary authors** of this paper and our work contributes toward advancing oncology research through cutting-edge AI techniques.
